## Listing tags

```bash
pipe tag myorg/deploy
```

Shows all local tags with their type, dirty status, and which one is HEAD:

```
TAG       TYPE       DIRTY  HEAD
latest    symlink    no     *
v1.0.0    symlink    no
dev       editable   yes
```

## Creating a tag

```bash
pipe tag myorg/deploy v1.0.0
```

Creates a new tag pointing to HEAD's current content. Uses blob deduplication — if the content already exists, no new blob is written.

To overwrite an existing tag:

```bash
pipe tag myorg/deploy v1.0.0 --force
```

## Deleting a tag

```bash
pipe tag myorg/deploy v1.0.0 --delete
```

You cannot delete the last remaining tag. Unused blobs are garbage collected automatically.

## Switching tags

```bash
pipe switch myorg/deploy v1.0.0
```

Updates HEAD to point to the specified tag. Without a tag argument, shows an interactive selection list:

```bash
pipe switch myorg/deploy
```

### Creating an editable tag

```bash
pipe switch myorg/deploy -b dev
```

Creates a new **editable** tag (`dev`) as an independent copy of the current HEAD content, then switches to it. Editable tags are regular files (not symlinks), so you can modify them locally without affecting other tags.

### Switching to a blob

You can switch directly to a content blob by its SHA-256 prefix:

```bash
pipe switch myorg/deploy abc123
```

This puts the pipeline in a **detached HEAD** state, where HEAD points directly to a blob rather than a tag.

## Tag types

| Type | Storage | Editable | Dirty detection |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Symlink** | Symlink to blob | No (read-only) | N/A |
| **Editable** | Regular file (copy) | Yes | Compares SHA-256 against index |

## Tag naming rules

- 1–128 characters
- Lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, dots
- Must start and end with a lowercase letter or digit
- No consecutive hyphens or dots
