## What is Pipe Hub?

Pipe Hub is a central registry for sharing and versioning pipelines. Instead of copying YAML files between machines, you can push a pipeline to Hub and pull it anywhere:

```bash
pipe push myorg/deploy
pipe pull myorg/deploy
```

## Local store layout

Hub pipelines are stored under `~/.pipe/hub/` using a git-like content-addressable layout:

```
~/.pipe/hub/<owner>/<name>/
├── index.json              # Metadata, tags, active tag
├── HEAD                    # Symlink → tags/<tag> or blobs/sha256/<hex>
├── blobs/
│   └── sha256/
│       └── <hex>           # Content-addressable YAML blob
└── tags/
    ├── latest              # Symlink → ../blobs/sha256/<hex>
    └── dev                 # Regular file (editable tag)
```

### index.json

Schema-versioned metadata including the pipeline owner, name, all pulled tags with their SHA-256 checksums, sizes, and timestamps.

### HEAD

A symlink pointing to the currently active tag (or directly to a blob in detached HEAD state). Pipe reads HEAD to determine which content to run.

### Blobs

Content-addressable storage keyed by SHA-256 hash. When you push or pull, Pipe deduplicates content — identical YAML produces the same blob.

### Tags

Tags point to blobs. A **symlink** tag is immutable (the content at that tag is frozen). A **regular file** tag (editable) is an independent copy that can be modified locally.

## Mutable vs immutable pipelines

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Immutable** | Tags cannot be overwritten once pushed (except `latest`). Guarantees reproducibility. |
| **Mutable** | Tags can be reassigned to new content. Useful for living pipelines that evolve. |

The mutability is set when the pipeline is created on Hub.

## Resolution

When you run `pipe myorg/deploy`, Pipe:

1. Loads `index.json` from `~/.pipe/hub/myorg/deploy/`
2. Reads `HEAD` to find the active tag (or blob)
3. Reads the YAML content from the tag/blob path
4. Parses and executes the pipeline
