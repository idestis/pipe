  Pipe Hub is in closed beta. Features and APIs may change.
</Aside>

## Logging in

Pipe uses a device authorization flow:

```bash
pipe login
```

This will:

1. Generate a device code and display a verification URL
2. Open your browser to the verification page
3. Poll for authorization until you approve the device
4. Save credentials to `~/.pipe/credentials.json`

If you're already logged in, Pipe prompts for confirmation before re-authenticating.

## Logging out

```bash
pipe logout
```

Removes stored credentials from `~/.pipe/credentials.json`.

## Unauthenticated access

Some Hub operations work without authentication (e.g., pulling public pipelines), but with lower API rate limits. Pushing always requires authentication.

## Custom Hub URL

Override the Hub API endpoint with the `PIPEHUB_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export PIPEHUB_URL=https://hub.internal.example.com
pipe login
```

Default: `https://hub.getpipe.dev`

## Credentials storage

Credentials are stored in plain JSON at `~/.pipe/credentials.json`. The file contains an API key used for `Authorization: Bearer` headers on all authenticated requests.
