## Moving a local pipeline to Hub

Convert a local pipeline file to a Hub pipeline:

```bash
pipe mv deploy myorg/deploy
```

### What happens

1. Reads the content from `~/.pipe/files/deploy.yaml`.
2. If `myorg/deploy` doesn't exist locally, creates the Hub directory structure with a `latest` tag.
3. If `myorg/deploy` already exists, imports the content as an untagged blob (detached HEAD state).
4. Deletes the original local file (`~/.pipe/files/deploy.yaml`).
5. Creates an alias `deploy` → `myorg/deploy` so existing scripts keep working.

## After moving

Your pipeline now lives in `~/.pipe/hub/myorg/deploy/`. You can:

- Run it the same way: `pipe deploy` (alias resolves it)
- Push it to Hub: `pipe push myorg/deploy`
- Create tags: `pipe tag myorg/deploy v1.0.0`
- Inspect it: `pipe inspect deploy`

## Alias auto-creation

The `mv` command automatically creates an alias from the old name to the new Hub path. This means any scripts or muscle memory using `pipe deploy` continues to work seamlessly.

If an alias with that name already exists, the move still succeeds but the alias is not overwritten — you'll need to update it manually with `pipe alias mv`.
