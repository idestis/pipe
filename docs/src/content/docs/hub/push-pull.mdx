  Pipe Hub is in closed beta. Features and APIs may change.
</Aside>

## Pulling a pipeline

```bash
pipe pull myorg/deploy
```

Downloads the `latest` tag by default. Specify a tag explicitly:

```bash
pipe pull myorg/deploy:v1.0.0
```

### What happens on pull

1. Pipe contacts the Hub API to get the tag metadata (SHA-256, size).
2. Downloads the YAML content.
3. Verifies the SHA-256 checksum.
4. Saves the content as a blob in `~/.pipe/hub/myorg/deploy/blobs/sha256/`.
5. Creates a tag symlink and updates `index.json`.
6. Validates the YAML.

### Dirty check

If you have local modifications to the pipeline (editable tag with changes), Pipe warns you and refuses to overwrite. Use `--force` to proceed:

```bash
pipe pull myorg/deploy --force
```

## Pushing a pipeline

```bash
pipe push myorg/deploy
```

Requires [authentication](/hub/authentication/).

### Tag selection

Tags are assigned with this precedence:

1. **`-t` flags** — explicit tag names
2. **Inline `:tag`** — from the command argument
3. **Default** — `latest`

```bash
# Push with explicit tags
pipe push myorg/deploy -t v1.0.0 -t latest

# Push with inline tag
pipe push myorg/deploy:v2.0.0
```

### What happens on push

1. Pipe reads the local content (from the active tag, a specific tag file, or local files).
2. Pre-checks remote tags for conflicts (up-to-date content, immutable tag protection).
3. Uploads the YAML content to Hub.
4. Hub returns the digest and tag assignments.
5. Pipe verifies the digest matches.
6. Re-snapshots the local blob store.

### Immutable vs mutable tags

- On **immutable** pipelines, you cannot overwrite an existing tag (the push fails).
- On **mutable** pipelines, pushing to an existing tag replaces the content.
- The `latest` tag can always be overwritten.

## Checksum verification

Both push and pull verify SHA-256 checksums to ensure content integrity. Pipe computes the digest locally and compares it against the Hub response.
