title: Aliases
description: Create short names for Hub pipelines.

## What are aliases?

Aliases let you run Hub pipelines with a short name instead of the full `owner/name` path:

```bash
# Without alias
pipe myorg/deploy

# With alias
pipe deploy
```

Aliases are stored in `~/.pipe/aliases.json`.

## Creating an alias

```bash
pipe alias add deploy myorg/deploy
```

This maps `deploy` to `myorg/deploy`. When you run `pipe deploy`, Pipe resolves it through the alias.

### Restrictions

- Alias names cannot conflict with reserved command words (`init`, `list`, `validate`, etc.).
- Alias names cannot shadow existing local pipeline files in `~/.pipe/files/`.

## Removing an alias

```bash
pipe alias rm deploy
```

## Reassigning an alias

Point an existing alias to a different target:

```bash
pipe alias mv deploy otherorg/deploy-v2
```

## Listing aliases

```bash
pipe alias list
```

Or simply:

```bash
pipe alias
```

Both show a table of all aliases and their targets.

## Resolution order

When you run `pipe <name>`:

1. **Alias** — checks `~/.pipe/aliases.json` for a matching alias
2. **Hub** — if the resolved name contains `/`, looks up the Hub pipeline
3. **Local** — checks `~/.pipe/files/<name>.yaml`

## Auto-created aliases

Some commands create aliases automatically:

- `pipe init owner/name` — creates an alias from `name` to `owner/name` (if no conflict)
- `pipe mv local-name owner/name` — creates an alias from `local-name` to `owner/name`
- `pipe rm` — cleans up aliases pointing to the removed pipeline
