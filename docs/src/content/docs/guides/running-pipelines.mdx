title: Running Pipelines
description: Verbosity levels, compact UI, logs, and state.

## Basic usage

Run a pipeline by name:

```bash
pipe deploy
```

Pipe resolves the name through the [alias chain](/guides/aliases/), then Hub, then local files at `~/.pipe/files/`.

## Variable overrides

Pass variables as positional arguments after the pipeline name:

```bash
pipe deploy env=production tag=v1.2.0
```

These override any values in the pipeline's `vars` section. See [Variables & Templating](/guides/variables/) for the full precedence chain.

## Verbosity levels

| Flag | Level | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| *(none)* | Warn | Compact mode — minimal output, suppresses info noise |
| `-v` | Info | Verbose — shows step start/finish, variable resolution |
| `-vv` | Debug | Debug — includes internal details, env construction |

```bash
pipe deploy -v       # verbose
pipe deploy -vv      # debug
```

## Compact UI

At the default verbosity (no `-v` flag), Pipe shows a compact status display: a spinner with the current step name, replaced by a success or failure indicator when the step completes. This keeps the terminal clean for pipelines with many steps.

## Logs

Run logs are written to `~/.pipe/logs/`. Each run produces a log file identified by the run ID.

### Log rotation

Control how many log files to keep with the `PIPE_LOG_ROTATE` environment variable:

```bash
export PIPE_LOG_ROTATE=10   # keep last 10 log files
```

Set to `0` to disable rotation (keep all logs). Unset or invalid values use the default.

## State files

Each run saves its state to `~/.pipe/state/<pipeline>/`. State files record which steps completed, their exit codes, and outputs (unless marked [sensitive](/guides/sensitive-data/)). This is what enables `--resume` — see [Resuming Failed Runs](/guides/resuming-runs/).

### State rotation

Control how many state files to keep with the `PIPE_STATE_ROTATE` environment variable:

```bash
export PIPE_STATE_ROTATE=5   # keep last 5 state files
```
