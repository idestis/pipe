description: What Pipe is and why it exists.

Pipe is a minimal, dependency-free pipeline runner for the command line. It replaces fragile, chained shell aliases with clear, structured YAML workflows that are easy to maintain, share, and collaborate on.

## Why Pipe?

Shell scripts grow messy. A deploy command starts as `docker build && docker push && ssh ...` and quickly becomes an unmaintainable one-liner. Pipe gives that one-liner a proper home:

```yaml
name: deploy
steps:
  - id: build
    run: "docker build -t myapp ."
  - id: push
    run: "docker push myapp"
    depends_on: "build"
  - id: deploy
    run: "ssh prod 'docker pull myapp && docker restart myapp'"
    depends_on: "push"
    retry: 2
```

Run it with `pipe deploy`.

## Capabilities

- **Sequential and parallel execution** — steps run in order by default, or in parallel when you use a list of commands
- **Dependency graph** — explicit `depends_on` declarations and implicit `$PIPE_*` variable edges, with cycle detection
- **Output passing** — each step's stdout is captured as `PIPE_<STEP_ID>` for downstream steps
- **Named sub-runs** — parallel commands with individual output capture
- **Variable templating** — Go `text/template` syntax with three-layer precedence (YAML, environment, CLI)
- **Step caching** — skip expensive steps that haven't changed, with duration or wall-clock expiry
- **Sensitive data** — redact outputs from state files, always re-execute on resume
- **Resume failed runs** — pick up where you left off with `--resume`
- **Retry on failure** — configurable per-step retry count
- **Hub (Beta)** — push, pull, and version pipelines with a central registry
