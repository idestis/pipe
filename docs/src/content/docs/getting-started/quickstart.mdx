## Create a pipeline

```bash
pipe init hello
```

This creates `~/.pipe/files/hello.yaml` with a starter template.

## Edit the pipeline

Open the file and replace the contents:

```yaml
name: hello
description: "My first pipeline"
steps:
  - id: greet
    run: "echo Hello from Pipe!"
  - id: date
    run: "date"
```

## Run it

```bash
pipe hello
```

Pipe runs each step in order, streaming output to your terminal.

## Pass variables from the CLI

Add a `vars` section:

```yaml
name: hello
description: "My first pipeline"
vars:
  name: "world"
steps:
  - id: greet
    run: "echo Hello, $PIPE_VAR_NAME!"
```

Override at runtime:

```bash
pipe hello name=Pipe
```
