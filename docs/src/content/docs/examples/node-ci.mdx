## Pipeline

```yaml
name: node-ci
description: "Install deps, lint, test, and build a Node.js project"
steps:
  - id: install
    run: "npm ci"

  - id: quality
    run:
      - "npm run lint"
      - "npm run typecheck"
      - "npm run test -- --coverage"
    depends_on: "install"

  - id: build
    run: "npm run build"
    depends_on: "install"

  - id: bundle-size
    run: "du -sh dist/ | cut -f1"
    depends_on: "build"
```

## Concepts demonstrated

- **[Parallel commands](/guides/parallel-execution/)** — `quality` runs lint, typecheck, and test concurrently
- **[Dependencies](/guides/dependencies/)** — both `quality` and `build` depend on `install`, but are independent of each other — they can run in parallel
- **[Output passing](/guides/writing-pipelines/#passing-output-between-steps)** — `bundle-size` captures the dist folder size as `$PIPE_BUNDLE_SIZE`
