## Synopsis

```
pipe mv <name> <owner>/<name>
```

## Description

Converts a local pipeline file to a Hub pipeline. Reads from `~/.pipe/files/<name>.yaml`, creates the Hub directory structure, deletes the original file, and creates an alias so the old name keeps working.

If the Hub pipeline already exists locally, the content is imported as an untagged blob (detached HEAD state) rather than creating a `latest` tag.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Local pipeline name |
| `<owner>/<name>` | Target Hub path |

## Flags

None.

## Examples

```bash
pipe mv deploy myorg/deploy
```

After this:
- `pipe deploy` still works (via alias)
- `pipe push myorg/deploy` uploads to Hub
- `~/.pipe/files/deploy.yaml` is deleted
