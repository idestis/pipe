title: pipe <pipeline>
description: Run a pipeline.
---

## Synopsis

```
pipe <pipeline> [KEY=value ...] [flags]
```

## Description

Runs the named pipeline. Pipe resolves the name through aliases, Hub, then local files. Variable overrides are passed as positional arguments in `KEY=value` format.

When run without arguments, Pipe prints help. When run with `<pipeline> help`, it shows pipeline-specific usage including variables and steps.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<pipeline>` | Pipeline name, alias, or `owner/name` path |
| `KEY=value` | Variable overrides (repeatable) |

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--resume <run-id>` | Resume a previous run by ID |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Increase verbosity (`-v` verbose, `-vv` debug) |

## Examples

```bash
# Run a local pipeline
pipe deploy

# Run with variable overrides
pipe deploy env=production tag=v1.2.0

# Run a Hub pipeline
pipe myorg/deploy

# Run a specific Hub tag
pipe myorg/deploy:v1.0.0

# Resume a failed run
pipe deploy --resume abc123

# Verbose output
pipe deploy -v
```
