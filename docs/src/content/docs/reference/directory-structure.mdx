Pipe stores all data under `~/.pipe/`. Here is the full directory tree:

## files/

Local pipeline YAML files. Created by `pipe init <name>` and used when no alias or Hub pipeline matches.

## hub/

Hub pipeline storage using a git-like content-addressable layout. Each pipeline has an `index.json` with metadata, a `HEAD` symlink pointing to the active tag, blob files keyed by SHA-256, and tag files that are either symlinks (immutable) or regular files (editable).

See [Hub Overview](/hub/overview/) for details.

## state/

Run state files that record which steps completed, their exit codes, and outputs. Used by `--resume` to pick up failed runs. Sensitive step outputs are excluded.

Controlled by `PIPE_STATE_ROTATE`.

## logs/

Run log files. Each run produces a log file identified by the run ID.

Controlled by `PIPE_LOG_ROTATE`.

## cache/

Step cache entries stored as JSON. Shared across all pipelines by step ID. Managed with `pipe cache list` and `pipe cache clear`.

## credentials.json

Hub authentication credentials stored after `pipe login`.

## aliases.json

Pipeline alias definitions mapping short names to `owner/name` Hub targets. Managed with `pipe alias`.
