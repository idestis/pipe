<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Sequential & Parallel" icon="rocket">
    **Run steps in order or in parallel — automatically.**
    Pipe executes commands sequentially by default, or concurrently when tasks are independent, giving you faster and predictable pipeline runs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dependency Graph" icon="random">
    **Define relationships, Pipe handles execution order.**
    Declare dependencies explicitly or let Pipe detect them automatically. Cycles are caught early to prevent broken pipelines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Variables & Templating" icon="setting">
    **Make pipelines reusable and configurable.**
    Use built-in templating with support for defaults, environment overrides, and CLI arguments — no duplication required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pipe Hub" icon="cloud">
    **Publish, install, and version pipelines.**
    Share pipelines through the Hub, reuse them across projects, and keep workflows consistent everywhere.
